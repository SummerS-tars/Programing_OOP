# Stage 2: Core GUI Layout Design and Responsive Adjustment

## Objective

Implement the main interface layout: a fixed-size chessboard area on the left, and a three-column information display area on the right. Ensure the layout's responsiveness when the window size is adjusted, with the chessboard remaining fixed and the information areas evenly occupying the remaining space.

## Prompt

Please implement the application's core GUI layout.

1.  Load FXML and Bind Controller: Ensure the `top.thesumst.Main` class correctly loads `MainGameView.fxml` and sets its controller to `top.thesumst.view.gui.GUIController`.
2.  Root Layout Container: Confirm that the root node of `MainGameView.fxml` is a `BorderPane`.
3.  Chessboard Area Container (Fixed Size):
    * In `GUIController`, bind the `StackPane` (fx:id=`chessboardContainer`) placed in the `left` region of the `BorderPane` in FXML using the `@FXML` annotation.
    * Strictly follow requirements: Ensure this `StackPane`'s `prefWidth` and `prefHeight` are explicitly set to fixed values in FXML (e.g., `600`x`600` pixels, this size should be sufficient for a reasonable display of a 15x15 chessboard), and its dimensions do not change when the window is resized.
    * Please remove any temporary placeholder `Label` inside `chessboardContainer`.
4.  Right Information Area:
    * In `GUIController`, bind the `GridPane` placed in the `right` region of the `BorderPane` in FXML using the `@FXML` annotation.
    * Confirm this `GridPane` contains three columns.
    * Responsive Layout: Confirm that `ColumnConstraints` are configured for the `GridPane` in FXML, using `hgrow="ALWAYS"` (or `percentWidth="33"`) to ensure these three columns can evenly occupy the available width of the `BorderPane`'s `right` region and stretch/shrink with window width changes.
5.  Window Minimum Size: In the `start()` method of the `top.thesumst.Main` class, set the minimum width and height for `primaryStage` to ensure the layout does not collapse when the window is shrunk.

## Testing and Acceptance Criteria
* After the application starts, the window displays a clear left-right layout.
* The chessboard area on the left (now an empty `StackPane`) has a fixed size and does not change when the main window is dragged or resized.
* The right area stretches and shrinks with changes in the main window's width, and its three internal columns visually maintain an even distribution.
* The window can be normally maximized, minimized, and resized by dragging, with stable layout behavior.

After this stage is completed, please clearly report its completion status and await my further instructions.
