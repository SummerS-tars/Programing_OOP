# Stage 6: Game Loop and Dynamic UI Update

## Objective

Integrate `GUIGameLoop` to drive the game process and update the GUI in real-time and responsively.

## Prompt

We will implement the core logic of `GUIGameLoop` to drive the game and dynamically update the GUI.

1.  Complete `GUIGameLoop`:
    * Implement the `startLoop()` and `gameLoop()` methods in `top.thesumst.core.loop.GUIGameLoop`.
    * `gameLoop()` should continuously fetch commands from `GUICommandProvider` in a loop, pass them to game logic for processing (e.g., by creating and executing `GameCommand` via `CommandFactory`), and then wait for game state updates.
2.  UI Update Mechanism (`Observer` Pattern):
    * Ensure the `top.thesumst.view.gui.GUIView` class (which already implements the `Observer` interface) is correctly registered as an observer of `top.thesumst.observer.BaseSubject` (e.g., your `GameList` instance).
    * In `GUIView`'s `update(Event event, GameList gameList, int currentGameOrder)` method, dynamically update the GUI based on `event.eventType` and the latest state of `gameList`:
        * Chessboard Update: Based on the `ChessBoard` state of the current game in `gameList`, redraw pieces, obstacles, and bomb craters in `chessboardContainer`. Ensure chessboard drawing meets Stage 3 requirements (adapt to fixed container, display row/column labels).
        * Legal Move Hints: In Reversi mode, 'reversi mode needs to further display each player's score... it is required to display all legal move positions for the current player on the chessboard (using +)'. Ensure `GUIView`, when updating the chessboard, can calculate and display '+' symbols based on game logic.
        * Right Information Panel Update: Update player names, scores (Reversi mode), bomb counts (Gomoku mode), current round number (Gomoku mode).
        * Game List Update: Update the content of `gameListView` to reflect the new game list.
        * Visibility Control: 'Different game types will have different GUI aspects, with specific requirements психолог previous labs.' Ensure `GUIView` dynamically controls the visibility of relevant UI elements (e.g., scores, bomb counts, round numbers, pass/use bomb buttons) based on the current game mode.
3.  Feedback Message Display:
    * The `Event` object will contain a feedback message (`Event.message`) after execution.
    * In `GUIView`'s `update` method, display `event.message` on the `feedbackMessageLabel` reserved in `MainGameView.fxml`.
4.  Multi-threaded UI Updates:
    * Crucial: Game logic processing (especially time-consuming operations) should run on a background thread outside the JavaFX Application Thread to avoid blocking the UI.
    * `GUIGameLoop` execution should be in a separate thread.
    * Any operation that needs to update the UI (i.e., calls to `GUIView.update()` method) must be executed on the JavaFX Application Thread using `Platform.runLater()`.
5.  Playback Mode Effect: 'The playback effect is that the GUI displays the state after each step is executed at fixed time intervals.' Please implement this animation effect, ensuring a fixed time interval between each operation (e.g., using `Timeline` or `PauseTransition`), and the UI updates synchronously without stuttering.

## Testing and Acceptance Criteria
* The game can proceed normally through GUI operations (clicking the board, buttons, etc.), with the interface responding in real-time without stuttering.
* Pieces and legal move hints on the chessboard update correctly according to the game state.
* Player information, scores, bomb counts, and round numbers on the right information panel update in real-time.
* When switching games, the interface correctly displays the chessboard and information for the corresponding game.
* `feedbackMessageLabel` correctly displays various feedback and error messages during the game.
* Playback mode can automatically demonstrate the game process at fixed time intervals, updating the GUI in real-time while keeping the UI smooth.

After this stage is completed, please clearly report its completion status and await my further instructions.
