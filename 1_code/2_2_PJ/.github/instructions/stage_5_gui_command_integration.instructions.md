# Stage 5: Integration of GUI Operations and Command Provider

## Objective

Thoroughly implement `GUICommandProvider` so it can receive GUI events, convert them into command strings processable by `InputParser`, and ensure `GUIGameLoop` can fetch commands through it.

## Prompt

Now, we will thoroughly implement the functionality of `GUICommandProvider` and integrate it with the GUI and the game loop.

1.  Implement `top.thesumst.io.provider.GUICommandProvider` Class:
    * Confirm its constructor calls `super(CommandProviderMode.GUI)`.
    * Implement its `getNextCommand()` method to block until a new command is available. This is typically achieved using a thread-safe queue (e.g., `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue<String>`) to store command strings received from GUI events.
    * Add a public method (e.g., `public void offerCommand(String command)`) for `GUIController` to call to add commands to the queue.
    * Implement a `hasCommand()` method to check if there are pending commands in the queue.
2.  Integrate `GUIGameLoop`:
    * Modify `top.thesumst.core.loop.GUIGameLoop`. In its `gameLoop()` method, instead of direct CLI input, it should fetch user input command strings via `GUICommandProvider`'s `getNextCommand()` method.
    * `GUIGameLoop` should pass the fetched command string to `top.thesumst.io.input.InputParser.parse()` for parsing, obtaining an `InputResult` object.
3.  Connect GUI Events to Command Provider:
    * Ensure that in `GUIController`, all commands triggered by GUI interactions (chessboard clicks, various button clicks, `ListView` item selections, etc.) correctly call `GUICommandProvider.offerCommand()`, passing the corresponding command string.
    * Command String Format: Command strings must strictly follow `InputParser`'s expected format (e.g., '1A', 'pass', 'peace', '@1A', 'playback test1.cmd', 'quit', '2', etc.).
    * Game Operation Conversion: 'In previous labs, games were controlled via keyboard input; in the project, they are controlled by clicking relevant components with the mouse.' This includes: 'Place piece: Keyboard input 1a -> Mouse click on the board cell corresponding to 1a.' 'Switch game: Keyboard input 2 --> Mouse click on the button corresponding to game 2.' 'New game: Keyboard input `gomoku`--> Mouse click on the button corresponding to new gomoku.' 'Reversi pass function: Keyboard input pass --> Mouse click on the pass button.' 'Gomoku bomb function: Keyboard input @1a --> Mouse click on the bomb button, then click on the board cell corresponding to 1a.' 'Quit game: Keyboard input quit --> Mouse click on the quit button.'
4.  Playback Mode File Selection Integration:
    * Add a click event to `playbackButton` that uses `javafx.stage.FileChooser` to allow the user to select a `.cmd` file.
    * After obtaining the file path, construct a command string like 'playback test1.cmd' and pass it to `GUICommandProvider.offerCommand()`.
5.  Error Message Passing: The `Event` object will contain a feedback message (`Event.message`) after execution. Ensure `GUIView` can receive and display these messages.

## Testing and Acceptance Criteria
* Run the application. All GUI operations (chessboard clicks, various button clicks, game list selection) can be captured by `GUICommandProvider` and converted into correct command strings.
* `GUIGameLoop` can drive the game process through `GUICommandProvider`, meaning the game can be played entirely via the GUI without any console input.
* After selecting a `.cmd` file through the file chooser, the correct `playback` command can be generated.

After this stage is completed, please clearly report its completion status and await my further instructions.
