# Stage 1: JavaFX Project Initialization, Basic Window Construction, and MOTD Display

## Objective

Successfully launch a basic JavaFX application that displays a window with a GUI-friendly MOTD (Message Of The Day).

## Prompt

Please help me initialize a Maven JavaFX project and implement the basic window and MOTD display.

1.  Maven Configuration Confirmation:
    * In the `<dependencies>` section of `pom.xml`, confirm that the `org.openjfx:javafx-controls:21` dependency is included.
    * In the `<build><pluginManagement><plugins>` section of `pom.xml`, confirm that `org.openjfx:javafx-maven-plugin` (version `0.0.8`) has its `<configuration><mainClass>` pointing to your main startup class (e.g., `top.thesumst.Main`).
2.  Main Application Class Setup:
    * Create or modify the `top.thesumst.Main` class to extend `javafx.application.Application`.
    * In the `start(Stage primaryStage)` method, set the title of `primaryStage` (e.g., "Board Game").
    * Load `MainGameView.fxml` as the root node of the main scene. Ensure the `MainGameView.fxml` file is located in the project's resources path (e.g., `src/main/resources/MainGameView.fxml`).
    * Set the loaded root node into a `Scene`, and set the `Scene` to `primaryStage`.
3.  GUI-fied MOTD:
    * Analyze the logic in `top.thesumst.view.console.CLIPrintTools` used to get the MOTD text.
    * In the `top.thesumst.view.gui.GUIController` class (which is the controller for `MainGameView.fxml`), bind the `Label` reserved in FXML (fx:id=`messageOfTheDayLabel`) using the `@FXML` annotation.
    * In the `GUIController`'s initialization method (e.g., `initialize()`), get the MOTD text content and set it to `messageOfTheDayLabel` for display. Ensure this display method is entirely achieved through GUI components and no longer relies on console printing.

## Testing and Acceptance Criteria
* The project can be successfully compiled and run.
* After the application starts, a JavaFX window pops up.
* The top of the window or a prominent position (defined by `MainGameView.fxml`) displays the welcome message (MOTD), which is displayed via GUI components, not console printing.
* The console should no longer automatically print the MOTD.

After this stage is completed, please clearly report its completion status and await my further instructions.
